load a URL (localhost /website) with JavaFX WebView

The JavaFX WebView (javafx.scene.web.WebView) component is capable of showing web pages (HTML, CSS, SVG, JavaScript) inside a JavaFX application. As such, the JavaFX WebView is a mini browser. The WebView component is very handy when you need to show documentation (e.g. Help texts), news, blog posts or other content which needs to be downloaded from a web server at runtime.

The JavaFX WebView uses the WebKit open source browser engine internally to render the web pages.
